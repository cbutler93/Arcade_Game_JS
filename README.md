# Arcade Game
Welcome to the classic 'frogger' type arcade game!

## Launching the Game
After downloading the project files, starting the game is easy.
To launch the game, simply open index.html in your browser and the game will start automatically.

## Game Objective
The objective of the game is to safely cross the road and into the water.

Along the way, you may encounter some bugs that are trying to take you out. If they get to you, it's game over!

## Game Controls
To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard.

**Up** = Move one square forwards (towards the water).  
**Down** = Move one square backwards (towards the grass).  
**Left** = Move one square to the left.  
**Right** = Move one square to the right.  

## Winning/Losing the Game

In the event of winning the game (reaching the water), or losing the game (eaten by a bug), the game will reset. The player will return to the starting grass area and a new wave of (slower or faster) bugs will invade.
